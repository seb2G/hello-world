1. By default your repository has one branch named master
2. When you create a branch off the master branch, youâ€™re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time.
3. Open a Pull Request > Merge your Pull Request > Delete Branch (since the change is already merged there is no need for tha branch anymore)
